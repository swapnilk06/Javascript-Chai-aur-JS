let, const & var in Javascript -

Q. - Why you can learn javascript?
=>  Js goal is that we will make product or build anything through JS.
 
- Criteria through create:
  1) Invite a user to the website
  2) User can fill registration form 
  3) In registration form get unique id for user (find out easily in database whenever user).

Storage - For store anything we required memory space.
        - In programming all work are store/retrieve info & optimize storing information.


Variables & Constants - 

*NOTE :-
Constants - Can't change after declare it.
Variables - Can change when required.

Q. - How to learn through Investigation of Document?

Declaration of Constant - 
e.g. -> const accountId = _ _ _

*NOTE :- When write variable name declaration it write in simple name(of variable), that easy to read by anyone.

*Shortcuts -
  - Comment "//" --> Ctrl+/
  - console.log(); --> log+Enter
  

Learn through Investigation - 

E.g. -
    const accountId = 144553
	let accountEmail = "swap@gmail.com"
	var accountPassword = "12345"
	accountCity = "Pune" // Its not proper way of declaration


const, let, var --> Javascript node.js, V8.. define its syntax assign it in memory.
E.g. - memory name give accountId & assign value 144553

const -
   - const means doesnot change its value after assign (value is locked not to be change).
   - you can also write it show as below, but node.js doesnot permission to change const value after assign.

E.g. - Can try to change constant accountId?
=> 
	const accountId = 144553
	let accountEmail = "swap@gmail.com"
	var accountPassword = "12345"
	accountCity = "Pune" // Its not proper way of declaration

	// Try to change const // not allowed
	accountId = 2
	console.log(accountId);
  
Error - TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

- Node.js can identify const assign value & show error.


Q. - can try to change accountEmail, accountPassword, accountCity values?
=>
	const accountId = 144553
	let accountEmail = "swap@gmail.com"
	var accountPassword = "12345"
	accountCity = "Pune" // Its not proper way of declaration
	
	// Try to change
	accountEmail = "swapin.com"
	accountPassword = "323212"
	accountCity = "Nashik"


2 ways of Print statement using console methods - 

1] Simple method -

    console.log(accountId);
=>
  144553

2] console another method for print -

E.g. - write all printing variable name in square bracket [ , ] with include comma.
   
   console.table([accountId, accountEmail, accountPassword, accountCity])   


RUN Code - 
terminal --> node 01_basics/01_variable.js

Q. - Difference between let & var?
=>
  - In javascript declare constant that have only one method - e.g. const accountId = _ _ _
  
  - IN javascript declare variable are 2 ways -
  1] let 
        - In "let" scope problem have remove remove from it.
        - Currently use "const" & "let" only in Javascript for declaration of variable.
  
  2] var 
		- Currently "var" can't used.
        - Intial time of JS some small problem with JS - Its has not knowledge of "scope" i.e. "{ }"
		- Intial days javascript have scope problem.
		- Issue in block scope & functional scope.


Comment In Javascript -
1] //
2] /* _ _ _ */


Another way of variable declaration -
1) E.g. - 
	accountCity = "Pune" // Its possible to declare variable but, Its not proper way of declaration

Undefined variable declaration in javascript -
2) E.g. -
	const accountId = 144553
	let accountEmail = "swap@gmail.com"
	var accountPassword = "12345"
	accountCity = "Pune" // Its possible to declare variable but, Its not proper way of declaration
	let accountState;
	
	// change value
	accountEmail = "swapin.com"
	accountPassword = "323212"
	accountCity = "Nashik"

	
	console.table([accountId, accountEmail, accountPassword, accountCity, accountState])

=>
┌─────────┬──────────────┐
│ (index) │    Values    │
├─────────┼──────────────┤
│    0    │    144553    │
│    1    │ 'swapin.com' │
│    2    │   '323212'   │
│    3    │   'Nashik'   │
│    4    │  undefined   │
└─────────┴──────────────┘


Semicolon in Javascript -

*NOTE :- Write ";" is not matter write or not.


E.g. - 01_variable.js

/*
4th - Let, const & var in Javascript 
*/

// Learn through Investigation

const accountId = 144553
let accountEmail = "swap@gmail.com"
var accountPassword = "12345"
accountCity = "Pune" // Its possible to declare variable but, Its not proper way of declaration
let accountState;

// accountId = 2 // not allowed by node JS

// Try to change other assigned values
accountEmail = "swapin.com"
accountPassword = "323212"
accountCity = "Nashik"

console.log(accountId);

console.table([accountId, accountEmail, accountPassword, accountCity, accountState])
