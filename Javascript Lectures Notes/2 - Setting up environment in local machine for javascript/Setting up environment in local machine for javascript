Setting up local environment -
E.g. -
1] Make folder & open folder in VS Code --> make file test.js 
2] Drag & Drop folder in VS Code

Q. - You can not think how to excute .js file ? Question you have think like how types of question think in brain?
Q. - What difference in write .js file not write .txt file?
Q. - Which S/W can execute it? How to write code?

text file => .txt
js file => .js

No most difference in these 2 files .txt & .js files
But in .js file text are not random (it inwith special meaning with syntax)
E.g. -
   console.log("Swapnil")
	
.txt & .js files difference -
   - .txt file & .js files difference is - which file can injection in S/W & execute it.
   - S/W like compiler, Interpreter...


*NOTE :- All over S/W's has own Syntax Strucutre Capability. 
       - When you write console ---> its allready define. i.e. .js, .py
	     - After except looking of main, console what next?..
	     - from console syntax, give you any input or process any data & what can you show in output?
	     - All above work done in S/W you called Compiler OR sometime called Interpreter.


Javascript & S/W -
    - Few years ago S/W are only available for browser.
		- Also many year ago S/W are not easily available. Most no. of process for configure it, setup are required long process.
		- S/W is a attached with only in browser(firefox or chrome) steps in browser are write index.html & script because S/W are attached with browser only. 
		- Recent days, move S/W from browser to standalone execution.
		   
After standalone execution working -
    - Javascript is not only for Browser language OR Frontend language.
	  - It also used in Backend, Mobile or used in everywhere etc...


Setup JS Environment -

Node JS Environment --> S/W for execute Javascript
Env useful
  - without making in a browser index file
  - without inspect mode console 

*NOTE :- Node JS & Deno Js are S/W or library have same & same founder --> Ryan Dahl (Mean lead founder)
       - For production grade Env -> Choose LTS

Code Writing Tool - Vs Code (Code Editor)


JS file Execution -

Open terminal --> node -v <== check version
              --> node test.js <== execute
			  
Other simple way of execution for making portfolio in browser work are in next.
